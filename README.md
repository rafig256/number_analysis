# Prime Factorization

## Introduction
This is a simple Python script that takes a positive integer as input and computes its prime factorization.

## Features
- Accepts user input for the number to be factorized.
- Efficiently calculates prime factors using a loop.
- Handles edge cases, such as non-positive inputs.
- Identifies and notifies if the input number is prime.

## Usage
Run the script in a Python environment:
```sh
python prime_factors.py
```
Then, enter a positive integer when prompted.

## Example
```
Enter a number to factorize: 28
The prime factors of 28 are: [2, 2, 7]
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
